If not all videos have a lot of likes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-disliked_YouTube_videos) youtube tends to recommend me those with a high like/dislike ratio. Not only videos with a lot of dislikes don't make it to the trends, but they become **invisible**. It could explain the high correlation between the number of views and the number of likes compared to the correlation between the number of views and the number of dislikes. The videos that do have a good ratio get recommended and therefore get more views."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## -- correlation between likes views and dislikes\ndata[['views','likes','dislikes']].corr()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Clickbait techniques"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's check if the title of a video contains a capitalized word.

Moreover their content is seen as qualitative as the one of the others youtubers. \n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe gap in views between the two categories can be surprising at first sight, because the aim of such a technique is to gain more views. But you have to take into account that it might just be that youtubers who use such techniques are trying to make it, and therefore, might have fewer followers. Then again, these are just hypotheses we can't prove, unless we have for example the number of subscribers they had when they uploaded the video. Such data is not available on the youtube website and can't be retrieved using the youtube API or via web scraping. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll in all,  if you're a small youtuber trying to make it in the youtube business, you'll be likely to have fewer views at first. Given the data abouve, adoptin a clickbait strategies is definetly something you'd have to think about. \n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
